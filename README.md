- 👋 Hi, I’m @AIAdverse. I was born in the sixties and educated in the seventies. The future world of computers was an exciting prospect for me.
- The older I get, the less impressed I am with both what computers promised and the current actualities. In my experience, computers are:
- 1) Not fast
  2) Not effective
  3) Not efficient.
I swear that I could do a lot of things quicker and more efficiently with parchment paper, quill, and some old-fashioned ink. Plus, it would last for much longer without being wiped out in an instant.
I am a big fan of Excell and Word. Beyond that.....nothing but disappointment and frustration.

AI will be the same. What happens when the data is no longer diverse as it losses it's current analogue base. 
Once information is copied and formulated into AI, errors will begin to appear without human intervention to prevent this. 
I am already seeing this happen on news feeds. Need I give examples! They are so bleeding obvious to anyone that opens a browser and knows thier subject from reading books (knowledge gained not the internet and especially not from reading Wikipedia).

We all have interconnected thoughts every day that that a computer could never make.
For example, I was speaking to my partner about a property near us that was up for sale. 
The conversation leads through several interconnected topics before ending with a discussion on nuclear bomb tests.
Something a computer could never, ever do.

I doubt that any of any of you are interested in these thoughts, why should you be? But anyway, please comment if you think I am being too pessimistic. 
In my defence, the above has been my lived experience. Please prove me wrong. 
I am begining to believe that Isambard Kingdom Brunel achieved more with a pencil, ruler and paper than arguably AI ever will, and at a fraction of the cost both in terms of money and potential harm to the planet.
